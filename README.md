# Beauty Basket üõçÔ∏è  

Beauty Basket is a demo shopping cart application built with React 18 and styled using the `styled-components` library. It allows users to browse beauty products, add items to their cart, view the selected quantities, and see the total cost. The application fetches product data from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/).  

This project is designed to showcase modern front-end development practices using Vite as the build tool and functional components in React.
